Suppose there is software company and there are different departments like development,marketing, production and sales. CEO of the company want to know about the detail of the 
employees who are highly paid in each of the department. Write a program using the concept of classes to implement the same.
#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
